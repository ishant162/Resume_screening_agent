   MODEL_NAME=gpt-4-turbo-preview
   TEMPERATURE=0.3
   
   SKILL_WEIGHT=0.5
   EXPERIENCE_WEIGHT=0.3
   EDUCATION_WEIGHT=0.2
```

5. **Prepare sample data**
   
   Create a job description file in `data/sample_jobs/`:
```bash
   mkdir -p data/sample_jobs data/sample_resumes data/outputs
```
   
   Add your job description and resume PDFs to the respective folders.

## **💡 Usage**

### **Basic Workflow** (Fast, no tools)
```bash
python scripts/run_agent.py \
    --job data/sample_jobs/ai_engineer.txt \
    --resumes data/sample_resumes/*.pdf
```

### **Enhanced Agentic Workflow** (Full analysis with tools)
```bash
python scripts/run_enhanced_agent.py \
    --job data/sample_jobs/ai_engineer.txt \

## **📊 Output**

The agent generates two main files in the output directory:

### **1. Screening Report** (`screening_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`)

A comprehensive markdown report containing:
- Executive summary
- Top candidates at a glance (comparison table)
- Detailed candidate profiles with:
  - Overall scores and recommendations
  - Skills analysis (matches, gaps, equivalents)
  - Experience assessment (with company context)
  - Education verification
  - Salary estimates
  - ATS compatibility scores
  - Bias analysis results
- Hiring recommendations
- Next steps

### **2. Interview Questions** (`interview_questions_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`)

Personalized interview questions for each candidate, organized by:
- Technical skills (4-5 questions)
- Skill gaps (2-3 questions)
- Experience deep-dive (3-4 questions)
- Behavioral/cultural fit (2-3 questions)

---

## **⚙️ Configuration**

### **Scoring Weights**

Adjust in `.env` or `config/settings.py`:
```python
SKILL_WEIGHT=0.5        # 50% weight
EXPERIENCE_WEIGHT=0.3   # 30% weight
EDUCATION_WEIGHT=0.2    # 20% weight
```

### **LLM Settings**
```python
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4-turbo-preview  # or gpt-4, claude-sonnet-4, etc.
TEMPERATURE=0.3                  # Lower = more deterministic
```

### **Tool Thresholds**

Edit in respective tool files:
- `SkillTaxonomy`: Similarity thresholds
- `QualityChecker`: Confidence thresholds
- `BiasDetector`: Bias severity levels

---

## **🎯 Key Agentic Features Explained**

### **1. Tool Coordinator (Intelligent Tool Selection)**

Instead of running all tools for all candidates, the LLM decides:
- "This candidate has a GitHub URL and claims to be a developer → Run GitHub analysis"
- "This company is unfamiliar → Run web search to verify"
- "Job has complex skill requirements → Use skill taxonomy"

**Why it matters**: Saves time and API costs by being strategic.

### **2. Quality Checker (Self-Reflection)**

The agent reviews its own work:
- Checks confidence levels
- Identifies inconsistencies
- Can trigger re-analysis if needed (up to 2 iterations)

**Why it matters**: Ensures high-quality results through self-improvement.

### **3. Skill Taxonomy (Semantic Understanding)**

Understands that:
- TensorFlow ≈ PyTorch (90% equivalent)
- React → Vue (related frameworks)
- Python > Django (hierarchical relationship)

**Why it matters**: Fairer evaluation, doesn't penalize candidates for using equivalent technologies.

### **4. Company Verification**

Uses web search to:
- Verify company exists
- Understand tech stack
- Identify industry/domain

**Why it matters**: Provides context for experience evaluation.

---

## **📈 Performance & Scalability**

- **Processing Time**: ~2-3 minutes per candidate (with full tools)
- **Parallelization**: Candidate enrichment can be parallelized
- **Caching**: Company and GitHub data are cached to avoid redundant API calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect API limits

---

## **🛡️ Ethical Considerations**

### **Bias Detection**

The system actively checks for:
- University prestige bias
- Age-biased language
- Gender-biased language
- Scoring inconsistencies

### **Fair Evaluation**

- Recognizes global degrees (BTech = BS, etc.)
- Values non-traditional education (bootcamps, self-taught)
- Considers experience as education substitute
- Uses semantic skill matching (doesn't penalize for using equivalent tools)

### **Transparency**

- All decisions are explained
- Scores are broken down by category
- Reasoning is provided for rankings

---

## **🔮 Future Enhancements**

Potential additions for even more capability:

- [ ] LinkedIn profile enrichment
- [ ] Multi-language resume support
- [ ] Video interview analysis
- [ ] Real-time ATS integration
- [ ] Candidate communication automation
- [ ] A/B testing for job descriptions
- [ ] Diversity metrics dashboard
